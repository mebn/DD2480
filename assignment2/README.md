# Assignment 2 - Continuous Integration
The purpose of this project is to implement a CI server for the course DD2480.

## How to build, run and, test
This assignment has been done using rust, and therefore requires the rust toolchain. It can be compiled with:

```
cargo build
```

and then ran with:

```
cargo run
```

Finally, tests can be run using the command:

```
cargo test
```


## P1 How compilation has been implemented

## P2 How test execution has been implemented

## P3 How notification has been implemented

## Our team (Essence standard)
We would classify our team as being in the state "formed". This is a regression from how we would classify how our team was performing at the end of assignment 1 which could be classified as "Collaborating". The reason for this regression is that the team has not been working as one cohesive unit for assignment 2, and communication has been poor as opposed to open and honest.

Note: this is a classification of the team as a whole, there are certain individual group members who have been performing very well, and who do not deserve blame for this regression.
