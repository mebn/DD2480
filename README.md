# DD2480

## Requirements
- [ ] the program should be functionally correct
- [ ] at least one unit test per LIC
- [ ] at least two tests (including a positive test and a negative test with invalid inputs) if applicable
- [ ] the collaboration is well structured and traceable

## Git Message Structure

- every commit is an atomic bug fix or feature, with a clear commit message. A prefix convention is appropriate, e.g., commit messages starting with "feat", "fix", "doc", "refactor").
- the commit contents reflect the commit message, every bug fix or feature commit contains a test (i.e., adds at least one test or modifies at least one existing test).
