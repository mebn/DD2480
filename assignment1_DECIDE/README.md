# Decide
The purpose of this project is to implement a *Launch Interceptor Program*.

By combining *planar data points*, parameters, *Launch Interceptor Conditions* (LICâ€™s), a *Logical Connector Matrix* (LCM), and a *Preliminary Unlocking Vector* (PUM), the `Decide()` method determines whether or not to launch. For full implementation details, see [this](decide.pdf).

## How to run
This project uses Java.

### Main program
The entrypoint to this program is `LaunchInterceptor.java`. You can run the program with:

```bash
javac src/*.java
java src.LaunchInterceptor
```

### Run tests
We use junit 4 for our tests. Inside VS Code, click the green run/play button next to each test.
